# first of all your repository has to be public.
# set your github pages settings:
# source: deploy from a branch. branch: none, /root. for now.
# if first time, create gh-pages branch from main:
git checkout -b gh-pages main
# get just the dist folder from main into gh-pages branch, you need to know the commit code from main:
git checkout e0f7de754cc99c1caaa27ccbde973f2a9c27ecef dist
git add .
git commit -m "commit dist"
# if first push of gh-pages:
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
# otherwise just
git push
# go set the github pages settings to use the gh-pages branch
# that should deploy it. check in github actions to see deployment
